How to Integrate Nagios Alerts with Telegram ( http://telegram.org )

Files that I have amended to get this to work and other parts that I've need to install, will update with more information as I have time.

Using Telegram-cli : https://github.com/vysheng/tg : I installed this under the Nagios user, follow their instructions to install and configure it rather than me write it and have to keep it updated

Bash Scripts, and a lot of tinkering, this is not finished or by any means properly done, just wanted to document what I had done.
